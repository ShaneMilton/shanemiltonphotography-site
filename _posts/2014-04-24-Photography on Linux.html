  <h3>Photography On Linux</h3>
  <p>With the recent changes to Adobe software to creative cloud we have been wanting to make the switch to Linux and open source software for our workflow. With software like Darktable and the Gimp we have been able to make the switch easily. Darktable is a Lightroom alternative that produces very good results. The interface does take time to get used to but when you are antiquated with it you can make presets to speed thing along.</p>

  <p>The Gimp is a Photoshop alternative the interface is somewhat different it is a bit slower then photoshop.  The speed will improve when version 2.10 is released as it will support GPU acceleration via OpenCL.</p>

  <p>The Linux distribution we have chosen is Arch Linux the software is up to date all the time as new versions of software are released.  Arch gets them within a few hours or within a day.  Ubuntu was used for some time but there where to many bugs and stability problems.  Linux has good support for color management and hardware calibrators for accurate color while editing photo or video.  Linux suits us very well and is fast and open source software is very good and we will be contributing to some of the software we use by offering feedback to the developers.  Here is the finale resulting photo after all editing.</p>
